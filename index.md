### Some CS Jokes
* What is it called when computer programmers taunt and make fun of each other on social media? It is called cyber boolean!
* Why was the computer programmer, who was a Pokemon fanatic, very upset about his Pokemon evolving? Because he expected Char-mander to evolve into a String-mander and not Charmelion!
